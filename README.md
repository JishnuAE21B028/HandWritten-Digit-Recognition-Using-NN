# HandWritten-Digit-Recognition-Using-NN
This project is a handwritten digit recognition system that leverages a neural network to classify digits from images.

* Main.py- Manages data loading, model training, and evaluation.
* RandInitialise.py- Provides random initialization for model weights.
* Model.py- Implements the neural network structure and training functions.
* Prediction.py- Contains functions for making predictions with the trained model.
* GUI.py- Implements a Tkinter-based interface for user interaction.

  # Packages installed and utilised

* numpy- Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions to operate on them.
* scipy- Offers scientific and technical computing tools, including optimization algorithms used to train the neural network.
* pillow- A library for image processing tasks, including loading, manipulating, and saving images.
* tkinter- A standard Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs), allowing users to draw digits and interact with the application.
